# JavaScript Rascal

**NOTE:** This is a solution to the bonus calculator with bugs added to it. The code has purposefully been solved in a different way to give you the experience of working with another code base. Finding bugs can be frustrating at times. If you don't feel like you're making progress, reach out to the person sitting next to you, the people around you or an instructor.

## Instructions

JaRa, The JavaScript Rascal, has struck the company headquarters. Per her calling card, she has only done damage to the company headquarters' `script.js` file, so only make changes to those files. She couldn't help herself, and has left some punny hints behind.

**NOTE: You should only modify five lines of code in total (one line per bug).**

To help guide you, the company's security team had made a list of things they have noticed:

1. Check the console for the for the first bug.
    - `Cannot read property 'something' of undefined` is an incredibly common error. What does it mean?
    - What does the error tell you? Which line should you be looking at? What is it saying is undefinded?
2. Check the console for the for the second bug.
    - What does the error tell you? Which line should you be looking at?
3. What would cause the calculation to produce NaN?
    - Use the console logs to help you.
        - Where do things go wrong?
        - When do we end up with `NaN` for the first time?
4. Why is Scout, our top performer, only getting a bonus of `2990`?
    - How are the bonuses calculated? What do they depend on?
5. Why is Robert, our lowest performer, getting a bonus of `660000`?
    - How are the bonuses calculated? What do they depend on?

Make sure to fork or download this repo so that you have your own instance of the code. Make the corrections, then upload them to your own repo.
